A minimalistic text editor
==========================

qw is a programmer-oriented, minimalistic text editor that inherits
some experience and algorithms from the Minimum Profit text editor [1],
but leaving out some of the most sophisticated features (scripting, etc.)
for the sake of simplicity and memory economy. The following goals
are defined:

 * Infinite undo/redo levels.
 * Wordwrapping by default.
 * Full utf-8 support (arbitrary encodings not supported).
 * Multithreaded I/O (file loading and saving).
 * Minor IDE capabilities, like calling make and parsing its
   output (also multhreaded).
 * Minor VCS support (like the one in Minimum Profit).
 * Multiplatform (which platforms TBD, at least curses and win32).
 * Syntax highlighting.
 * Basic color definitions.
 * Basic key remapping.

This is a work in progress. Any change can happen.

This software is released into the public domain.
